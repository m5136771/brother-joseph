        <h2>About the Bot</h2>
        <p>
          Brother Joseph is a Discord bot created as a replacement for the now
          unsupported LDS-Bot. Its primary purpose is to provide text of
          scripture references from LDS-specific scriptures, currently focusing
          on the Book of Mormon. It is designed to support members of the LDS
          church and those interested in learning more. In the future, the bot
          will offer support for additional LDS publications and scriptures, as
          well as enhanced features such as searching and cross-referencing.
